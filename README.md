# The Repository consists of 3 assignments.
<br>
Assignment 1:
Analysing the past 3 years of data of stock prices for 3 different stocks. Finding the expected returns, volatility and the correlation matrix to see how the stock prices of different stocks move relative to each other and how good is a portfolio containing of these 3 stocks.
<br>
Assignment 2: 
Making various portfolios by varying the weight matrix and plotting them on the risk vs return graph along with the effecient frontier.
<br>
Assignment 3: 
Using cvxpy for formulating and solving the risk minimisation problem ensuring a minimum return that can be taken in from the user.
<br>
Assignment 4 (Final Project):
The program first takes n inputs of stocks listed on yfinance from the user. It also asks the user for a parameter lamda which denotes the risk tolerance. It then uses cvxpy to findthe portfolio with maximum return for the given risk tolerance. It also plots the optimal portfolios for 100 different risk tolerances spread across uniformly in the range of 0.1 to 100. finally it forms the effecient frontier (return v/s volatility) consisting of the above found portfolios.
